              Neffex (stylized as NEFFEX) is an American music project by Bryce Savage (also known as Brandon Horth) that originally included Cameron Wales. They produced remixes and original songs characterized by a mixture of electronic and rap genres. Before Savage continued the project on his own, he wrote lyrics and sang while Wales created instrumentals and performed editing. They have released many of their songs royalty-free (no-copyright) to assist content creators.

              Savage and Wales first met in high school when they were 15 years old. At that time, they were involved in a punk rock band. Thereafter, both exited the band and started making their own music. However, this was not yet the creation of Neffex. After high school, Wales moved to Los Angeles and got distant from Savage during college. When Savage was in the last year of college, he talked to Wales and they noticed both were making music in their free time. After college, they got together again, in Orange County, and created the name "NEFFEX" and the fox symbol.On his YouTube channel Savage exclaimed that the fox symbol was not the original intention, instead, he wanted to make something that was easy to replicate similar to the infamous "cool S" style, hence why it consists of three triangles.

            The NEFFEX story might be the only thing more unique than the Southern California duo’s genre-shattering music. In 2016 the pair of lifelong friends—Bryce Savage [vocals] and Cameron Wales [guitar, DJ]—decided to release an original song every Wednesday at 9am for 100 weeks. Using their own innovative twists and D.I.Y. spirit, they went even further and shared their music, royalty-free, with hundreds of YouTube channels, influencers, and blogs. Their songs exploded in popularity and, by 2018, they had unleashed over 110 originals, plus remixes, that blended the sonic worlds of guitar-driven pop, alternative, electronic and hip-hop. These tracks self-produced, self-mixed/mastered and self-written have amounted to a billion streams & still growing by 60+ million monthly.The NEFFEX story might be the only thing more unique than the Southern California duo’s genre-shattering music.
